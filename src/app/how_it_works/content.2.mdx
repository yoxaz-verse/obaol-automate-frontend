## Step 1: Trade Context & Intent

Every engagement starts with understanding the trade context.

This includes:
- Commodity and specification  
- Volume and timeline  
- Domestic or export flow  
- Counterparty type  
- Execution complexity  

At this stage, OBAOL focuses on **intent clarity**, not activity.

> If trade intent is not genuine, execution will fail later.

---

## Step 2: Opportunity Identification

OBAOL actively identifies relevant trade opportunities.

This is not open listing or random discovery.

Opportunities are:
- Context-matched  
- Volume-aligned  
- Time-sensitive  
- Execution-feasible  

The objective is relevance, not noise.

---

## Step 3: Seriousness & Readiness Filtering

Before execution begins, seriousness is filtered.

This step helps remove:
- Price checkers  
- Information extractors  
- Non-ready participants  
- Time-wasters  

Filtering early protects:
- Time  
- Capital  
- Reputation  

> Most execution failures start with the wrong counterparty.

---

## Step 4: Counterparty Verification

Verification is a core responsibility of OBAOL.

Depending on the trade, this may include:
- Identity and business validation  
- Stock or capacity confirmation  
- On-ground or third-party checks  
- Trade history assessment  

Verification is not a one-time tick.  
It is contextual and trade-specific.

---

## Step 5: Execution Coordination

Once terms align, OBAOL stays involved during execution.

Support may include:
- Follow-ups and coordination  
- Documentation alignment  
- Timeline monitoring  
- Issue escalation when required  

This is the stage where most trades collapse without structure.

OBAOL’s role is to **maintain continuity**.

---

## Step 6: Trade Completion

OBAOL remains involved until the trade successfully completes.

Completion means:
- Execution is concluded  
- Commitments are honoured  
- No unresolved gaps remain  

We do not exit at contact or agreement.

> Our responsibility ends only when execution ends.

---

## How This Helps Established Traders

For experienced operators, OBAOL provides:
- Reduced execution risk  
- Better control as volumes scale  
- Protection of long-term relationships  
- Structured support during complex trades  

OBAOL strengthens what already works.

---

## How This Helps New Entrants

For serious new entrants, OBAOL provides:
- Exposure to real trade execution  
- Early discipline and structure  
- Reduced chance of costly mistakes  
- Clear understanding of how trades actually close  

This opens the industry **without lowering standards**.

---

## What OBAOL Does Not Do

To keep roles clear, OBAOL does not:
- Act as a buyer or seller  
- Influence pricing  
- Guarantee outcomes  
- Replace your decision-making  

OBAOL supports execution.  
Trade decisions remain yours.

---

## Engagement Discipline

OBAOL engages selectively.

We participate only where:
- Trade intent is genuine  
- Execution support adds value  
- All parties are aligned toward completion  

Our involvement is **success-linked**.

We stay accountable until execution concludes.

---

## In Simple Terms

> OBAOL brings structure to a relationship-driven industry  
> so that more trades complete, not just start.

That is how OBAOL works.
