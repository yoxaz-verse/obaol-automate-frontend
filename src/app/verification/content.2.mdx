## How OBAOL Approaches Verification

OBAOL does not rely on generic profiles or one-time checks.

Verification is:
- **Context-driven**  
- **Trade-specific**  
- **Stage-aware**  

What is verified depends on:
- Commodity type  
- Volume and value  
- Domestic or export flow  
- Execution complexity  

> Verification adapts to the trade — not the other way around.

## What OBAOL Verifies

Depending on the engagement, verification may include:

### 1. Identity & Business Legitimacy

- Business identity confirmation  
- Operating history assessment  
- Relevance to the trade context  

This establishes who you are actually dealing with.

---

### 2. Trade Readiness

- Stock availability or sourcing capacity  
- Ability to execute within timelines  
- Alignment with agreed specifications  

This filters intent from capability.

---

### 3. Execution Credibility

- Past execution behaviour  
- Consistency in communication  
- Willingness to follow execution discipline  

Serious traders behave differently under verification.

---

### 4. Contextual Ground Checks

Where required, verification may involve:
- On-ground confirmation  
- Third-party validation  
- Trade-specific cross-checks  

This is applied selectively, not universally.

---

## Verification Is Not a One-Time Event

Many failures occur **after initial checks**.

OBAOL continues verification:
- When terms change  
- When timelines shift  
- When execution pressure increases  

Verification is maintained until execution completes.

---

## What Verification Is Not

To keep expectations clear, verification is not:

- A guarantee of outcome  
- A replacement for commercial judgment  
- A public rating system  
- A substitute for contracts  

Verification reduces risk.  
It does not eliminate it.

---

## How Verification Protects Both Sides

Strong verification benefits:
- Buyers seeking reliable supply  
- Sellers protecting serious stock  
- Traders safeguarding reputation  

It aligns expectations early and prevents avoidable conflict later.

---

## Verification for New Entrants

For serious new entrants, verification provides:
- Early discipline  
- Clear execution expectations  
- Reduced exposure to bad actors  

This allows new participants to enter the industry  
**without weakening trust**.

---

## Engagement Discipline

OBAOL applies verification selectively.

We engage only where:
- Trade intent is genuine  
- Verification adds execution value  
- All parties accept structured oversight  

Our involvement is **success-linked**.

We remain accountable until execution concludes.

---

## In Summary

Commodity trade runs on trust,  
but trust must be verified under execution pressure.

OBAOL brings structured verification  
so that trades are executed with clarity, confidence, and control.
