## How OBAOL Supports Procurement

OBAOL does not replace your procurement team.  
We work **alongside it** to strengthen execution.

Our role typically includes:

### 1. Requirement Clarity

Every procurement engagement begins with clarity on:
- Commodity and specification  
- Quantity and lot structure  
- Origin and seasonality  
- Delivery timeline  
- Domestic or export flow  

Clear requirements reduce downstream disputes.

---

### 2. Source & Counterparty Validation

Before procurement proceeds, OBAOL helps validate:
- Supplier credibility  
- Stock readiness or sourcing capacity  
- Trade seriousness  
- Alignment with agreed terms  

Validation is contextual and trade-specific.

---

### 3. Execution Coordination

Once procurement is initiated, OBAOL supports:
- Ongoing follow-ups  
- Timeline tracking  
- Alignment between buyer and supplier  
- Early identification of execution risks  

This prevents last-minute surprises.

---

### 4. On-Ground Discipline

For sensitive or high-value trades, procurement often fails due to lack of ground discipline.

OBAOL helps ensure:
- Commitments are honoured  
- Communication remains clear and professional  
- Deviations are flagged early  

This protects both sides of the trade.

---

### 5. Procurement Completion

OBAOL remains involved until procurement is completed as agreed.

Completion means:
- Quantity and quality alignment  
- Timelines respected  
- No unresolved execution gaps  

We do not disengage mid-process.

## Who This Is For

OBAOL procurement support is relevant for:

- Traders sourcing bulk agricultural commodities  
- Exporters managing multi-origin procurement  
- Buyers requiring execution reliability  
- Firms where procurement failure carries real cost  

If procurement is informal or low-risk, OBAOL may not be required.

If procurement is critical, structured support matters.

## What OBAOL Does Not Do

To maintain role clarity, OBAOL does not:
- Own inventory  
- Act as the supplier  
- Influence pricing  
- Guarantee outcomes  

Trade decisions remain yours.  
OBAOL supports execution discipline.

## Procurement for New Entrants

For serious new entrants, procurement is often the most fragile stage.

OBAOL helps new operators:
- Understand real procurement dynamics  
- Avoid common sourcing mistakes  
- Execute responsibly from the start  

This allows the industry to open up **without lowering standards**.

---

## Engagement Discipline

OBAOL engages selectively in procurement.

We participate only where:
- Requirements are clear  
- Trade intent is genuine  
- Execution support adds value  

Our involvement is **success-linked**.

We stay accountable until procurement execution concludes.

---

## In Summary

Procurement fails not because of lack of opportunity,  
but because of lack of structure.

OBAOL brings structure to procurement  
so that sourcing executes as agreed — reliably and professionally.
