## Verification Disclaimer

Verification conducted by OBAOL is intended to **reduce execution risk**, not eliminate it.

Verification:

OBAOL:

- Does not physically handle goods

Final operational decisions and contracts with service providers remain the responsibility of the trading parties.

These tools:
- Support human decision-making
- Do not replace commercial judgment

- Do not influence pricing or outcomes

Technology is used as an **enabler**, not a decision-maker.

---

## No Financial or Investment Advice

- Financial advice
- Investment advice
- Speculative trading recommendations

All activities relate strictly to **real-world agricultural and commodity trade execution**.

---

## Right to Refuse or Disengage

OBAOL reserves the right to:
- Decline participation in any trade

## Final Note

OBAOL Supreme exists to make agro trade **more structured, safer, and easier to execute**.

However, trade always involves risk.

OBAOL supports execution —  
it does not replace responsibility.
