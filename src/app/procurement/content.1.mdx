# Procurement Support

Procurement is where most commodity trades are truly tested.

Price agreement alone does not guarantee supply.  
Execution, coordination, and on-ground discipline determine whether procurement actually happens.

OBAOL supports procurement by adding **structure, verification, and continuity** to the process.

## The Reality of Commodity Procurement

In practice, procurement challenges often include:

- Stock availability changing after confirmation  
- Quality or specification mismatch  
- Delays in readiness or dispatch  
- Poor coordination between parties  
- Breakdowns once advance discussions begin  

These issues rarely appear during negotiation.  
They surface **during execution**.

OBAOL exists to reduce these risks.
