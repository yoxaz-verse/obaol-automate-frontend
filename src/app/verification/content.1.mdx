# Verification Framework

In commodity trade, most losses do not happen because of price.

They happen because of **who you are dealing with**.

Verification is not a checkbox.  
It is a continuous discipline applied at the right stages of execution.

OBAOL treats verification as a **core responsibility**, not an optional step.

## Why Verification Matters

In real trade conditions, traders often face:

- Counterparties who misrepresent stock or capacity  
- Entities that disappear after price confirmation  
- Documentation that does not match ground reality  
- Reputational damage from failed execution  

These risks increase as volumes scale.

OBAOL exists to reduce this uncertainty.
