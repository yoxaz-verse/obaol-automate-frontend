# Why OBAOL

Most commodity traders do not fail because of lack of contacts.

They fail because **execution breaks under pressure**.

OBAOL exists to solve that exact problem — without disrupting how trade already works.

## The Hard Truth About Commodity Trade

In agro and commodity markets:

- Buyers exist  
- Sellers exist  
- Prices are discussed daily  

Yet deals still collapse.

Not at the discovery stage.  
At the execution stage.

Common realities traders face:

- Counterparties disappear after price confirmation  
- Stock quality or quantity does not match claims  
- Prices are used only to extract market information  
- Logistics, documentation, or coordination breaks midway  

These are not platform problems.  
These are **execution problems**.
